In the meantime, here are the things that were required from my end:

Front cover and back cover each:

782 px height (206.9 mm)
487 px width (128.8 mm)

Margins:

- 27 px (7.14 mm) from all edges (except spine)
- 40 px (10.58 mm) from the bottom edge on front cover

Formula for spine width (in mm):

{(no. of pages/2)*80*1.43/1000}+0.6
